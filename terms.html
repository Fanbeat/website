	<h2>CONTESTS</h2>
	<p>FanBeat offers games for fans to play during live events such as sporting contests. The goal of the games is to correctly answer questions to predict future events and trivia questions.</p>
	<p>After you create an account, you will be able to view the games available for entry ("<strong>Contests</strong>"). While some Contests may be free to enter, certain Contests on the Services will require an entry fee ("<strong>Paid Contests</strong>"). It is your responsibility to know and understand the rules and required entry fees for any given Contest. Please note that you must meet all eligibility requirements and otherwise comply with any other applicable rules to be eligible to win a prize. In particular, due to restrictions in state law, residents of excluded states are not eligible to participate in our Paid Contests.</p>
	<p>The Official Rules for each game are disclosed and accessible through the game entry pages. We strongly encourage you to read the Official Rules for each game to understand the game mechanics, point system, how to win any prizes that are available, and how to claim an awarded prize. You must first register with a valid email address in order to claim an awarded prize.</p>
	
	<h3>Contest of Skill</h3>
	<p>Contests, including Paid Contests, are games of skill. Each of our Contests are governed by specific rules, as may be modified from time to time, which are set forth in the Contest official rules and are incorporated into these Terms by this reference. Winners are determined by the objective criteria described in the Contest deadline, roster, Rules, scoring, and any other applicable documentation associated with the Contest. From all entries received for each Contest, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant information to accumulate either points based on correct answers or correct picks according to the corresponding scoring rules. The Site, App, and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit gambling.</p>
	
	<h3>Creating an Account</h3>
	<p>You may view content on the Services for FanBeat or FanBeat Daily without registering for an account, but as a condition of using certain aspects of the Services, including entering Contests, you are required to create an account ("<strong>Account</strong>"). You represent that the information in your Account and any other piece of information otherwise provided to us, is accurate, current and complete information, and agree to update it and keep it accurate, current and complete. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account or your access to the Services if any information provided to us proves to be inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.</p>
	<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities, charges, and damages that occur under your account. It shall be a violation of these Terms to allow any other person to use your account to participate in any Contest.  If you discover any unauthorized use of your account, or other known account-related security breach, you must report it to <a href="mailto:support@fanbeat.com">support@fanbeat.com</a> immediately. You agree that you are responsible for anything that happens through your account until you close your account or prove that your account security was compromised due to no fault of your own.</p>
	<p>Each individual user may establish only one (1) Account. For avoidance of doubt, users may not "co-own" accounts on the Service. In the event FanBeat discovers that you have opened more than one account, in addition to any other rights that FanBeat may have, FanBeat reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and terminate, withhold, or revoke the awarding of any prizes. Nothing in this section restricts you from making multiple entries into a contest.</p>
	
	<h3>Purpose of Account</h3>
	<p>You agree that the sole and specific purpose of creating an account on FanBeat is to participate in fantasy sports Contests.

In such circumstances, we may also report such activity to relevant authorities.</p>
	
	<h3>Entry Fees</h3>
	<p>Paid Contests each have an entry fee listed in US dollars. The entry fee may vary from Contest to Contest.

FanBeat, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a Contest or the entire Service, refuse to award points or prizes and require the return of any prizes, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct FanBeat deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users.</p>

	<h2>DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS</h2>
	
	<h3>Deposits</h3>
	<p>Creating a FanBeat account is free. However, there are associated fees for certain Contests and Account types. When you use a service that has a fee you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. To pay for such services, you must provide the information necessary to process such requests. FanBeat uses third-party electronic payment processors and financial institutions to process deposits and/or payments for services or products offered via the Services. You agree to pay the charges incurred in accordance with these Terms and applicable pay services.</p>
	<p>To participate in Paid Contests, you will be required to deposit funds into your Account by any of the methods permitted on the Services. Such funds will be deposited into your Account upon actual receipt of the funds by FanBeat. Minimum and maximum limits may be applied to deposits into your Account, depending upon your history with the Services, the method of deposit, state-imposed deposit limits, and other factors as determined solely by FanBeat. We are not a bank and funds are not insured by any governmental agency. No interest is payable on amounts on deposit in your Account. All payments into your Account must be from a payment source on which you are the named account holder. It shall be a violation of these Terms for you to submit payment using any payment method that you are not the named account holder. In addition, to be eligible to deposit money into your Account and play in Contests that award prizes, you must not be subject to backup withholding tax from the IRS.</p>
	<p>If any deposit is charged back any winnings generated from FanBeat Contests shall be invalidated, forfeited and deducted from your Account balance. In addition, the amount of the initial deposit will be invalidated, forfeited and deducted from the Account balance. FanBeat reserves the right to close your account - without notice - should a deposit be charged back.</p>
	<p>By depositing funds or entering paid Contests, you agree to provide us with information we may reasonably require in order to run appropriate identity checks and anti-fraud checks to comply with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, you may be required to provide appropriate documentation that allows us to verify you. While your account is pending verification, you may be able to deposit funds into your account and participate in Contests, but you will not be able to withdraw any funds from your account until verification is complete. If we are unable to verify you, we reserve the right to suspend your account and withhold any funds until such time as we have been able to successfully verify you.</p>
	
	<h3>Withdrawals</h3>
	<p>You may request a withdrawal of funds from your available cash balance in your Account at any time. Such withdrawals may be subject to a minimum withdrawals amount or if deposits are based on promotional bonuses. You may not request a withdrawal while you have a pending deposit. To withdraw funds based on promotional bonuses, the Entrant must use the equivalent of the applicable promotional bonuses one time as entry fees prior to withdrawal.</p>
	<p>Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Services. You acknowledge that, in order to complete withdrawals, Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification as reasonably requested by FanBeat in order to complete the withdrawal of prizes. We also may conduct checks for Terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on playing patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with these Terms in any manner.</p>
	<p>Processing of requested funds back may take up to five (5) business days; provided, however, FanBeat reserves the right to freeze your Account and/or delay a request for withdrawal of funds pending completion of any investigation of reported or suspected abuse by a user requesting withdrawal of funds. If you do not receive your withdrawal within five (5) business days, please contact customer support at <a href="mailto:support@fanbeat.com">support@fanbeat.com</a>. Withdrawal requests may be processed by ACH or by check. Checks for withdrawal requests are sent via U.S. Mail and may take up to 10 business days for delivery.</p>
	<p>If your Account is closed by us for a violation of the Terms, we reserve the right to determine whether to declare as void any transaction placed by you. If a prize has been awarded on a closed account due to fraud FanBeat may withhold the prize, provided that the prize is then awarded to another participant in the Contest who would have won the prize had that user not participated. In such an event, we use your Account funds to defray the costs of administration and enforcement of the Terms.</p>
	
	<h3>Taxation</h3>
	<p>All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. All winners who have won $600 or more over the previous year must provide updated address and social security details to FanBeat. These details will be used to allow FanBeat to comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate tax authorities. In compliance with United States Internal Revenue Service regulations, FanBeat may be required to submit a Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income (Form 1099) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other appropriate form to any person who wins in excess of $600 (USD) on the Services in any given year. FanBeat reserves the right to withhold (from your existing account balance and/or from future net winnings) any amount required to be withheld by law. You remain solely responsible for filing and paying all federal and other taxes in accordance with the laws that apply in your local, state, province, and/or country of residence. FanBeat does not provide tax advice, nor should any statements in these Terms or on the Service be construed as tax advice.</p>
	
	<h3>Bonuses and Promotions</h3>
	<p>From time to time, FanBeat may provide you with promotional discounts or bonuses - for example, as an incentive to use FanBeat's Services, to establish a FanBeat account or to refer others to sign up with FanBeat.

	<p>Neither FanBeat nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the use of or inability to use the Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not FanBeat has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
	
	<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
	<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute that arises in whole or in part from the Site shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia using the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User and FanBeat agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S. federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (ii) seek injunctive relief in a U.S. court or law or (iii) file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms of Service, User and FanBeat agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Fulton County, Georgia for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>

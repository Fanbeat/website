	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>The Promotion is a free (standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply) game for fans to play during any Entry Period. For each Entry Period, as directed, a minimum of twenty-two (22) skill-based questions during regulation game time and up to three (3) additional questions per overtime period will be posed and will be available in the App beginning at the start of the Entry Period and thereafter during the applicable Entry Period. For each question participants must submit an answer before the timer (typically 30-45 seconds) expires at the bottom of the screen. The Promotion will consist of random drawings ("Instant Win Prizing" and "Promotion Period Prizing") and a skill-based competition ("Contest") as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
		<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
			<li>Entry Period Instant Win Prizing (Drawing(s)): For each question answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant without regard for whether the answer is correct, such eligible participant will receive one (1) entry in an Instant Win animated drawing(s) for the applicable Entry Period. For each Entry Period, one (1) potential winner of the Drawing will be selected by random drawing from among all eligible entries received during such Entry Period. FanBeat and Caesars, may elect, from time to time during the Promotion Period to conduct multiple Instant Win Drawings during an Entry Period. Subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the terms of these Official Rules, the potential winners will be declared the official winners of the Instant Win Drawing (each, an "Instant Win Drawing Winner"). Odds of winning an Instant Win Drawing Prize depend on the total number of eligible Instant Win Drawing entries received during the applicable Entry Period.</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 10px;">Promotion Period Prizing (Drawing): At the end of the Promotion Period (listed specifically in the Promotion Period section above), all eligible participants that answered questions during the Promotion Period, without regard for whether the answers are correct, will receive one (1) entry in the Promotion Period Drawing for each question they answered. The participant will be entered into a Promotion Period Prize Drawing for the identified Promotion Period Prizes (identified below as the "Promotion Period Prizes") and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. The Promotion Period Prize Drawing process is executed as follows: each question answered by an eligible participant during the Promotion Period will be converted to a ticket and the Operator will randomly draw a winning ticket for each Promotional Period Prize out of the sum total of all eligible players. The Operator will conduct the Prize Drawing in order of highest ARV prize to lowest ARV prize. Participants are not eligible to win multiple Promotion Period Prizes. Those eligible participants whose names are drawn offline by the Operator will be declared official winners of the Promotion Period. Odds of winning a Promotion Period Prize depend on the total number of eligible Promotion Period Prize entries received and the number of total questions answered during the Promotion.</li>
			<li style="margin-top: 10px;">Entry Period Contest Prizing: For each question correctly answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, such eligible participant will receive the points specified for the correctly answered question. These points will accumulate for the Entry Period, identified in the game as Game Points, where Game Points is defined as the aggregate value of all points earned for questions answered correctly during the Entry Period and displayed on the Game Leaderboard in the App.
				<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
					<li>At the end of each Entry Period, the eligible participants that received the most points for such Entry Period will be potential winners and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules, will be declared official winners of the Contest for that Entry Period (each, an "Contest Game Winner"). In the event of a tie for a specific Entry Period prize (each, a "Contest Game Prize"), the participant who had the highest score on the final countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be considered the winner of the Contest Game Prize. In the event that the tied participants also had equal scores on the final countdown trivia question, the participant who had the highest score on the second to last countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be deemed the Contest Game Winner. In the event that the tied participants continue to be tied, score comparisons on each subsequent countdown trivia questions will be compared until a winner is determined. In the event that the tied participants are still tied after all countdown trivia questions are compared, each participant will be awarded a Contest Game Prize.</li>
					<li>During the Promotion Period, any eligible participant who answers all Entry Period questions correctly, when the total number of questions asked is no fewer than twenty-two (22) questions for an Entry Period, will be a potential Grand Prize winner ("Grand Prize Winner") subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. In the event that multiple participants qualify as potential Grand Prize Winners for a single Entry Period, the qualifying potential Grand Prize Winners will receive an equal split of the Grand Prize (defined below) offered for the Entry Period.</li>

In consideration for providing you the Services, you agree that we and our third party providers and partners may place advertising on our Services or in connection with the display of content or information on our Services.</p>


	<h2>Rights and Terms for Apps</h2>
	<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you have the right to download and install a copy of any Apps to your mobile device for your own personal use. With respect to each App you download, you may not: (i) copy, modify or distribute the App for any purpose; (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the App or the Services to any third party; (iii) decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App or the Services; (iv) make the functionality of the App or the Services available to multiple users through any means; or (v) use the Services in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these Terms.</p>

	<li>The App Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, the App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</li>
	<li>You must also comply with all applicable third party terms of service when using the App.</li>

	<h2>Game Rules</h2>
	<p>FanBeat is a free game for fans to play during live events such as sporting contests. The goal of the game is to correctly answer both questions to predict future events and trivia questions in order to earn points and compete against other fans playing the game.</p>
	<p>The Official Rules for each game are expressly linked under the â€œBegin Playing!â€ button designated for entering the game. The Official Rules are also posted at the bottom of the Pre Game and Prize Board screens. We strongly encourage you to read the Official Rules for each game to understand the game mechanics, point system, how to win any prizes that are available, and how to claim an awarded prize. You must first register with a valid email address in order to claim an awarded prize.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Links to Third Party Websites or Resources</h2>
	<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. We provide these links only as a convenience and are not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from those websites or resources or links displayed on such sites. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from, your use of any third-party websites or resources.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Indemnity</h2>
	<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless FanBeat, its parent corporation, officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Services; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that material you submitted through the Services caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Services.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Termination</h2>
	<p>We may terminate your access to and use of the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Services or your Account, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Warranty Disclaimers</h2>
	<p>The Services and Content are provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind. Without limiting the foregoing, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any Content.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
	<p>Neither FanBeat nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the use of or inability to use the Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not FanBeat has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
	<p>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute that arises in whole or in part from the Site shall be resolved by binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia using the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, User and FanBeat agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S. federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (ii) seek injunctive relief in a U.S. court or law or (iii) file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms and Conditions, User and FanBeat agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Fulton County, Georgia for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
	
	
	<h2>California Disclosure</h2>
	<p>California residents may reach the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
	
	
	<h2>General</h2>
	<p>You agree that these Terms, along with the FanBeat Privacy Policy and any relevant game-specific Official Rules, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between FanBeat and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between FanBeat and you regarding the Services. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
	<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without FanBeat prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. FanBeat may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
	<p>Any notices or other communications provided by FanBeat under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: by FanBeat (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
	<p>FanBeat's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of FanBeat. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>

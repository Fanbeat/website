	<small>Last Updated: 4/8/2019</small>

	<p>Thank you for visiting the FanBeat website or mobile app. FanBeat recognizes that people who use our services value their privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information about our collection, use and disclosure (under certain situations) of User information from the FanBeat website and mobile app (the "Service"). FanBeat provides this Privacy Policy to help the User make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use FanBeat.</p>

	<p>When you use the FanBeat Service, any personal information you provide remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the FanBeat Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). Each of these documents may be updated from time to time.</p>

	<p>If you have any comments or complains about the FanBeat Privacy Policy, please email to <a href="mailto:feedback@fanbeat.com">feedback@fanbeat.com</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Information Collection</h2>
	
	<p>We collect information from you in several different ways in our Service. One goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. For example, we can use your personal information to:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>help make the Service easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
		<li>help us create content in the Service that is most relevant to you.</li>
		<li>alert you to new information and products that we offer.</li>
		<li>notify you of any prizes you may have won in our live competitions.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>(a) Registration. Before using certain parts of the Service, you may have to register with your Facebook credentials or by providing certain personal information such as name and email address. These kinds of personal information are used to provide a unique experience within the Service, to communicate with you about your account, and for marketing purposes.</p>
	
	<p>(b) Email Addresses. Several locations of the Service may permit you to enter or for us to capture your email address for purposes including but not limited to: to register for promotions or products; or to request us to notify you regarding particular promotions or products. Your participation in a promotion is completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to us. We use this information to notify promotion winners and to award prizes. We may post on our Site the names and cities of contest winners.</p>
	
	<p>(c) Cookies and Other Technology. Like many websites, the Service may employ cookies, location based services and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or "action tags") to speed your navigation of the Services, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your usage.</p>
	
	<p>(i) Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you may not be able to access or use portions of the Service. THIS SERVICE's COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER'S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not "spyware".</p>
	
	<p>(ii) Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on this Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon. We may also use web beacons to collect information about whether our electronic communications to our users have been delivered, viewed and opened. This data may impact the quantity and content of future communications from us to our users.</p>
	
	<p>(iii) We may use third-party companies to help us tailor Services content to users or to serve ads or messages on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising or messaging effectiveness (such as which web pages are visited, which messages are responded to, or what products are purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked (by them) to any personal information collected by us.</p>
	
	<p>(d) Log Files. As is true of most websites, the Site automatically recognizes the Internet URL or location from which you access the Site. We may also log your Internet protocol ("IP") address, Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes. (An IP address may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet.) We may also log detailed User usage of the Service to inform decisions on how to improve future versions of the Service.</p>
	
	<p>(e) Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Service and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 18 years old. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 18, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases. By using the Service, you affirm that you are 18 years of age or older. Certain competitions offered within the Service may be available only to older participants. These age requirements are clearly designated upon entry into the competition and in the official rules for the competition. You also affirm, by accessing or using the Service, that you are of legal age to enter into agreements or, if you are not, that you have obtained your parent's or legal guardian's consent to accept the terms in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
	<h2>Information Use and Disclosure</h2>
	
	<p>(a) Internal Use. We use your personal information to provide secure access and a personalized experience when using the Service. We may internally use, and share with our parent company any affiliates, your personal information to improve our Service's content and features, to improve our outreach and for our own marketing efforts (including marketing our services and products to you), and to determine general marketplace information about visitors' usage behavior to the Service.</p>
	
	<p>(b) Communications with You. We will use your personal information to communicate with you about our Service and about upcoming events offered by sports teams and other partners with whom we have relationships. Also, we may send you a confirmation email when you register with us. We may send you a service-related announcement on the rare occasions when it is necessary (for example, if we must temporarily suspend our service for maintenance.) Also, we will send you a notification email when you request us to notify you when particular products or promotions become available. We always permit you to unsubscribe from product availability notifications. </p>
	
	<p>(c) External Use. We want to provide you with excellent service and to offer you a great, personalized experience with the FanBeat Service. We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal or transactional information to anyone except as described below:</p>
	
	<p>(i) We have relationships with sports teams and others who help manage the competitions offered by the Service on mobile devices. We may provide them some personal information such as your name, email, and/or phone number so that they may contact you about events you may be interested in. We also provide them at the conclusion of each of their events a report which contains the name, email address, phone number and participation history of each of the registrants for that event.</p>
	
	<p>(ii) We may offer products or promotions from third parties on our Service. If you choose to purchase their products or participate in any third party promotions, you authorize us to share your personal information (such as name, email address, and/or phone number) with these third parties, who may contact you about the promotion or other promotions you might be interested in. We will only share your personal information with these parties if you choose to purchase their products or participate in their promotions. (iv) It's possible that we might merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your personal information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect.</p>
	
	<p>(iii) We may be required to disclose certain information in response to requests from law-enforcement officials conducting investigations; subpoenas; a court order; or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law. We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce other agreements, or to protect ourselves or others. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use our Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.</p>
	
	<p>(iv) We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular Service event) with third parties such as sports teams and sponsors. This information does not directly personally identify you or any user.</p>
	
	<h2>Data Security</h2>
	
	<p>FanBeat uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to FanBeat and you do so at your own risk.</p>
	
	<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
	
	<p>The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Site from the European Union, Canada or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Site, which is governed by Georgia law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms and Conditions, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by Georgia law for these purposes.</p>
	
	<h2>California Disclosures</h2>
	
	<p>California Information-Sharing Disclosure: California residents may request a list of all third parties with respect to which we have disclosed any information about you for direct marketing purposes and the categories of information disclosed. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please send us a written request by email to <a href="mailto:feedback@fanbeat.com">feedback@fanbeat.com</a> with "California Privacy Rights" in the subject line. California Do Not Track Disclosure: Depending on the browser you are using, you may be able to choose to block third party cookies or browse in a private browsing mode. The information that we collect is governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

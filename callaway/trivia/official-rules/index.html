	<h3>How to Play</h3>
	<p>The Promotion is a free (standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply) game for fans to play during an Entry Period. For an Entry Period, participants submit answers, as directed, to up to eleven (11) skill-based questions, including the pre-game question, that will be available in the App beginning at the start of the Entry Period and thereafter during the applicable Entry Period. For each question, with the exception of the pre-game question, participants must submit an answer before the timer (typically 30-45 seconds) expires at the bottom of the screen. Participants may submit an answer to the pre-game question at any time after the Pre-Game Start Time and before the Pre-Game End Time. The Promotion will consist of random drawings ("Instant Win Prizing") and a skill-based competition ("Contest") as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Entry Period Instant Win Prizing (Drawing(s)): For each question answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, including the pre-game question and without regard for whether the answer is correct, such eligible participant will receive one (1) entry in an Instant Win animated drawing(s) for the applicable Entry Period. For each Entry Period, one (1) potential winner of the Drawing will be selected by random drawing conducted by Operator from among all eligible entries received during such Entry Period. FanBeat may elect, from time to time during the Promotion Period, to conduct multiple Instant Win Drawings during an Entry Period. Subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the terms of these Official Rules, the potential winners will be declared the official winners of the Instant Win Drawing (each, an "Instant Win Drawing Winner"). Instant Win Drawing Winner will be awarded the prize(s) identified in the chart below ("Instant Win Prizes") that correspond to the Entry Period for which the Instant Win Drawing Winner's entry was drawn. Odds of winning an Instant Win Drawing Prize depend on the total number of eligible Instant Win Drawing entries received during an Entry Period.</li>
		<li>Contest: For each question correctly answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, including the pre-game question, such eligible participant will receive the points specified for the correctly answered question. These points will accumulate for the Entry Period, identified in the game as "Game Points," where Game Points is defined as the aggregate value of all points earned for questions answered correctly during the Entry Period and displayed on the "Game Leaderboard" in the App.</li>
		<li>At the end of each Entry Period, the eligible participants that received the most Game Points for such Entry Period will be potential winners and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules, will be declared official winners of the Contest for that Entry Period (each, an "Entry Period Game Winner"). Each Entry Period Game Winner will be awarded the Entry Period prize(s) (each, a "Game Prize") identified in the chart below that corresponds to the Entry Period and the number of Game Points the Entry Period Round Winner accumulated for such Entry Period relative to the other participants (e.g., in what "place" - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. - the Entry Period Round Winner finished). In the event of a tie for a specific Entry Period prize, the participant who had the highest score on the final countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be considered the winner of the Entry Period Game Prize. In the event that the tied participants also had equal scores on the final countdown trivia question, the participant who had the highest score on the second to last countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be deemed the Entry Period Game Winner. In the event that the tied participants continue to be tied, score comparisons on each subsequent countdown trivia questions will be compared until a winner is determined. In the event that the tied participants are still tied after all countdown trivia questions are compared, each participant will be awarded an Entry Period Game Prize.</li>

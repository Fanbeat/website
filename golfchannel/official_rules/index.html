Please note: the App is free; however, standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply; check with your carrier for pricing details. Wireless service is not available in all areas. Entries must comply with these Official Rules.</p>
	<p>Promotion entries during the Promotion Period that are generated by script, macro or other automated means or utilizing any other method or means which, in Operator's sole discretion, impacts the integrity of the Promotion or is in violation of these Official Rules will be void. The Operator reserves the right to disqualify any Promotion participant from the Promotion at any time if the Operator determines that the participant has entered the Promotion using automated means.</p>
	
	<h2>Promotion Administration</h2>
	<p>The Promotion is administered by the Operator.

If you have questions regarding the administration of the Promotion, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@fanbeat.com">support@fanbeat.com</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>The Promotion is a free (standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply) game for fans to play during any Entry Period. For each Entry Period, participants must submit an answer, as directed, to up to forty (40) skill-based questions that will be available in the App beginning at the start of the Entry Period and thereafter during the applicable Entry Period. For each question participants must submit an answer before the timer (typically 30-45 seconds) expires at the bottom of the screen. The Promotion will consist of random drawings ("Instant Win Prizing" and "Promotion Period Tournament Prizing") and a skill-based competition ("Contest") as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
		<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
			<li>Entry Period Instant Win Prizing (Drawing(s)): For each question answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant without regard for whether the answer is correct, such eligible participant will receive one (1) entry in an Instant Win animated drawing(s) for the applicable Entry Period. For each Entry Period, one (1) potential winner of the Drawing will be selected by random drawing from among all eligible entries received during such Entry Period. FanBeat, Golf Channel and Callaway, may elect, from time to time during the Promotion Period to conduct multiple Instant Win Drawings during an Entry Period. Subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the terms of these Official Rules, the potential winners will be declared the official winners of the Instant Win Drawing (each, an "Instant Win Drawing Winner"). Odds of winning an Instant Win Drawing Prize depend on the total number of eligible Instant Win Drawing entries received during the applicable Entry Period.</li>
			<li>Promotion Period Tournament Prizing (Drawing): At the end of each of the Promotion Period Tournaments (listed specifically in the Promotion Period section above), all eligible participants that answered questions during the Promotion Period of that specific tournament, without regard for whether the answers are correct, will receive one (1) entry in the Promotion Period Tournament Drawing for each question they answered. The participant will be entered into a Promotion Period Tournament Prize Drawing for the identified Promotion Period Tournament Prizes (identified below as the "Promotion Period Tournament Prizes") and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. The Promotion Period Prize Drawing process is executed as follows: each question answered by an eligible participant during a Promotion Period Tournament will be converted to a ticket and the Operator will randomly draw a winning ticket for each Promotional Period Tournament Prize out of the sum total of all eligible players. The Operator will conduct the Prize Drawing in order of highest ARV prize to lowest ARV prize. Participants are not eligible to win multiple Promotion Period Tournament Prizes per Tournament. Those eligible participants whose names are drawn offline by the Operator will be declared official winners of the Promotion Period Tournaments (each, a "Promotion Period Tournament Winner"). Odds of winning a Promotion Period Tournament Prize depend on the total number of eligible Promotion Period Tournament Prize entries received and the number of total questions answered during the Promotion.</li>
			<li>Contest: For each question correctly answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, such eligible participant will receive the points specified for the correctly answered question. These points will accumulate for the Entry Period, identified in the game as Round Points, where Round Points is defined as the aggregate value of all points earned for questions answered correctly during the Entry Period and displayed on the Round Leaderboard in the App.
				<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
					<li>At the end of each Entry Period, the eligible participants that received the most points for such Entry Period will be potential winners and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules, will be declared official winners of the Contest for that Entry Period (each, an "Entry Period Round Winner"). In the event of a tie for a specific Entry Period prize (each, an "Entry Period Round Prize"), the participant who had the highest score on the final countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be considered the winner of the Entry Period Round Prize. In the event that the tied participants also had equal scores on the final countdown trivia question, the participant who had the highest score on the second to last countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be deemed the Entry Period Round Winner. In the event that the tied participants continue to be tied, score comparisons on each subsequent countdown trivia questions will be compared until a winner is determined. In the event that the tied participants are still tied after all countdown trivia questions are compared, each participant will be awarded an Entry Period Round Prize.</li>
					<li>During the Promotion Period, any eligible participant who answers all Entry Period questions correctly, when the total number of questions asked is no fewer than twenty (20) questions for an Entry Period, will be a potential Grand Prize winner ("Grand Prize Winner") subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. In the event that multiple participants qualify as potential Grand Prize Winners for a single Entry Period, the qualifying potential Grand Prize Winners will receive an equal split of the Grand Prize (defined below) offered for the Entry Period.</li>

	<h2>Grand Prize</h2>
	<p>Any eligible participant that answers all Entry Period questions correctly during a single Entry Period, and when the total number of questions asked is no fewer than twenty (20), as determined by the Operator in its sole discretion, will win all or a portion of one million U.S. dollars (US $1,000,000) awarded in an annuity or lesser lump sum as described below (the "Grand Prize").</p>
	<p>In the event that more than one (1) eligible participant answers all Entry Period questions correctly during a single Entry Period, when the total number of questions asked is no fewer than twenty (20), and qualifies for the Grand Prize, the Grand Prize will be divided evenly among all qualifying participants for that Entry Period.</p>
	<p>In the event of a single Entry Period Grand Prize Winner, the Grand Prize will be awarded as a forty (40) year annuity with a payment of up to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) per year over forty (40) years for a total cash payout of up to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), less withholding for income tax and other statutory requirements. Alternatively, the Grand Prize Winner may elect a single lump sum payment of Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000). Payments will be made to any Grand Prize Winner by the Operator's insurer. Should there be multiple Entry Period Grand Prize Winners, the Grand Prize will be divided evenly among qualifying winners for the Entry Period.</p>
	<p>In no event will more than two (2) total Grand Prizes be awarded for the entire aggregate Promotion Period. In the event that two (2) total Grand Prizes are awarded during the Promotion Period, the Promotion will continue through the end of the Promotion Period as scheduled with all other prizes available to win.</p>
	<p>Before claiming the Grand Prize, a Grand Prize Winner will be required to provide an affidavit attesting to his or her eligibility and compliance with the Official Rules of the Promotion, along with any other written documentation or information required by the Operator's insurer.</p>
	<p>PGA Tour tournament, rounds, event and exhibition dates and times are determined at the sole discretion of the Office of the Commissioner of the PGA Tour, as applicable, and may be subject to change. Released Parties will not be responsible for weather conditions, Acts of God, acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, work stoppage or any other natural disaster outside their control that may cause the cancellation or postponement of any PGA Tour event.</p>
	<p>From time to time, the game producer for the Operator may void (cancel) a question that it determines in its sole discretion was either (a) incorrectly stated or answered, or (b) is not applicable based on the game play. In this situation the voided question will not count as an active question in determining participants' eligibility for the Grand Prize. The voided question may be replaced by the game producer in order to offer at least twenty (20) active, non-voided questions. In all cases, a Grand Prize Winner is required to correctly answer all active questions of an Entry Period, with a minimum of at least twenty (20) active, non-voided questions in order to be eligible to win the Grand Prize.</p>
	<p>In the event that an error is made by the Operator and fewer than twenty (20) active questions are posted for an Entry Period, no participants will be eligible to win the Grand Prize for that Entry Period.</p>

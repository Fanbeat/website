Please note: the App is free; however, standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply; check with your carrier for pricing details. Wireless service is not available in all areas.

	<p>Promotion entries during the Promotion Period that are generated by script, macro or other automated means or utilizing any other method or means which, in Operator's sole discretion, impacts the integrity of the Promotion or is in violation of these Official Rules will be void. The Operator reserves the right to disqualify any Promotion participant from the Promotion at any time if the Operator determines that the participant has entered the Promotion using automated means.</p>
	
	<h2>Promotion Administration</h2>
	<p>The Promotion is administered by the Operator. By participating in the Promotion, each participant agrees that the Operator will solely resolve any disputes and rules violations that arise in connection with the Promotion, and its decisions relating to such matters shall be final and binding in all respects. If you have questions regarding the administration of the Promotion, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@fanbeat.com">support@fanbeat.com</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>The Promotion is a free (standard data usage and other carrier fees may apply) game for fans to play during any Entry Period. For each Entry Period, participants must submit an answer, as directed, to up to forty (40) skill-based questions that will be available in the App beginning at the start of the Entry Period and thereafter during the applicable Entry Period. For each question participants must submit an answer before the timer (typically 30-45 seconds) expires at the bottom of the screen. The Promotion will consist of random drawings ("Instant Win Prizing" and "Promotion Period Tournament Prizing") and a skill-based competition ("Contest") as follows:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 10px;">
		<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
			<li>Entry Period Instant Win Prizing (Drawing(s)): For each question answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, without regard for whether the answer is correct, such eligible participant will receive one (1) entry in an Instant Win animated drawing(s) for the applicable Entry Period. For each Entry Period, one (1) potential winner of the Drawing will be selected by random drawing conducted by Operator from among all eligible entries received during such Entry Period. FanBeat may elect, from time to time during the Promotion Period, to conduct multiple Instant Win Drawings during an Entry Period. Subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the terms of these Official Rules, the potential winners will be declared the official winners of the Instant Win Drawing (each, an "Instant Win Drawing Winner"). Instant Win Drawing Winner will be awarded the prize(s) identified in the chart below ("Instant Win Prizes") that correspond to the Entry Period for which the Instant Win Drawing Winner's entry was drawn. Odds of winning an Instant Win Drawing Prize depend on the total number of eligible Instant Win Drawing entries received during the applicable Entry Period.</li>
			<li>Promotion Period Tournament Prizing (Drawing): At the end of each of the Promotion Period Tournaments (listed specifically in the Promotion Period section above), all eligible participants that answered questions during the Promotion Period of that specific Promotion Period Tournament, without regard for whether the answers are correct, will receive one (1) entry in the "Promotion Period Tournament Drawing" for each question they answered. The participant will be entered into a Promotion Period Tournament Drawing for the identified Promotion Period Tournament Prizes (identified below as the "Tournament Prizes") and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. The Promotion Period Tournament Drawing process is executed as follows: each question answered by an eligible participant during a Promotion Period Tournament will be converted to a ticket and the Operator will randomly draw a winning ticket for each Tournament Prize out of the sum total of all eligible players. The Operator will conduct the Promotion Period Tournament Drawing in order of highest ARV prize to lowest ARV prize. Participants are not eligible to win multiple Tournament Prizes per Promotion Period Tournament; limit one (1) Tournament Prize per participant per Promotion Period Tournament. Those eligible participants whose names are drawn offline by the Operator will be declared official winners of the Promotion Period Tournaments (each, a "Promotion Period Tournament Winner"). Each Promotion Period Tournament Winner will be awarded the prize(s) identified in the chart below that correspond to the Promotion Period Tournament and Tournament Prize for which the Promotion Period Tournament Winner's entry was drawn. Odds of winning a Tournament Prize depend on the total number of eligible Tournament Prize entries received and the number of total questions answered during the Promotion.</li>
			<li>Contest: For each question correctly answered during an Entry Period by an eligible participant, such eligible participant will receive the points specified for the correctly answered question. These points will accumulate for the Entry Period, identified in the game as "Round Points," where Round Points is defined as the aggregate value of all points earned for questions answered correctly during the Entry Period and displayed on the "Round Leaderboard" in the App.
				<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
					<li>At the end of each Entry Period, the eligible participants that received the most Round Points for such Entry Period will be potential winners and subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules, will be declared official winners of the Contest for that Entry Period (each, an "Entry Period Round Winner"). Each Entry Period Round Winner will be awarded the Entry Period prize(s) (each, a "Round Prize") identified in the chart below that corresponds to the Entry Period and the number of Round Points the Entry Period Round Winner accumulated for such Entry Period relative to the other participants (e.g., in what "place" – 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. – the Entry Period Round Winner finished). In the event of a tie for a specific Entry Period prize, the participant who had the highest score on the final countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be considered the winner of the Entry Period Round Prize. In the event that the tied participants also had equal scores on the final countdown trivia question, the participant who had the highest score on the second to last countdown trivia question for the Entry Period will be deemed the Entry Period Round Winner. In the event that the tied participants continue to be tied, score comparisons on each subsequent countdown trivia questions will be compared until a winner is determined. In the event that the tied participants are still tied after all countdown trivia questions are compared, each participant will be awarded an Entry Period Round Prize.</li>
					<li>During the Promotion Period, any eligible participant who answers all Entry Period questions correctly, when the total number of questions asked is no fewer than twenty (20) questions for an Entry Period, will be a potential Grand Prize winner ("Grand Prize Winner") subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with these Official Rules. In the event that multiple participants qualify as potential Grand Prize Winners for a single Entry Period, the qualifying potential Grand Prize Winners will receive an equal split of the Grand Prize (defined below) offered for the Entry Period.</li>

	<p>From time to time, the game producer for the Operator may void (cancel) a question that it determines in its sole discretion was either (a) incorrectly stated or answered, or (b) is not applicable based on the game play. In this situation the voided question will not count as an active question in determining participants' eligibility for the Grand Prize. The voided question may be replaced by the game producer in order to offer at least twenty (20) active, non-voided questions. In all cases, a Grand Prize Winner is required to correctly answer all active questions of an Entry Period, with a minimum of at least twenty (20) active, non-voided questions in order to be eligible to win the Grand Prize.</p>
	<p>In the event that an error is made by the Operator and fewer than twenty (20) active questions are posted for an Entry Period, no participants will be eligible to win the Grand Prize for that Entry Period. Released Parties shall not be responsible or liable to any third party or participant for such error or omission.</p>
